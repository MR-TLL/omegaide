There are lot more features to explore. Give it a try.

## Installing

For installation on Debain or its derivatives use the .deb installer in the release section.
For Other Distros download the Omega IDE.zip file from the release section. 
It contains three files (**one shell script, one desktop entry, one image-icon and a runnable jar file**) and I think you know what to do with them.

## Editing
For Editing the source codes you can use even Omega IDE,
Just clone this repository and open the folder **omegaide** as the project root. Setup the **res** directory as the resource root and the **jfontchooser-vX.jar** as the jar dependency.

Thats all.
